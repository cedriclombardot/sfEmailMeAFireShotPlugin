## Documentation for  link_sfEmailMeAFireShot

*link_sfEmailMeAFireShot($name_for_link,$mode="edit",$options=array());*

  * name_for_link : The title of the link
  * mode : **edit** to open fireshot editor or **email** to send an email  or  **form** see after
  * options : array for the link tag

## Form mode

The form mode will go to open an Jquery Superbox to help you to send and email with the capture attached in the mail

You could define email_to for the mail recipient (eg : the api that will insert your bug into Redmine or mantis)

The email from is set to :

  * myUser::getMail() if defined
  * email_to if defined
  * or email_from


## How it works

  1. If fireshot is not installed, the link will be replaced by a download link to install the extensions
  2. If you're not on Win or Firefox the link will be hidden
  3. Else the action will be done
